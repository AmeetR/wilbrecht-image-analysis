# Create a Project using peach. The parameters are explained below:
# command: defines that 'test.sh' will be executed on Linux Workers and
#          'test.bat' on Windows Workers.
# platform:   defines that only Workers with a Linux or Windows can be assigned
#             Jobs
# parameters: defines that first input argument is the value of multip variable
#            (2) and second input argument will be replaced by a peachvector 
#             element (2 for Job #1, 4 for for Job #2 etc)
# projectparameters: sets the value of the 'multip' variable to '2'
# outputfiles: defines that the file 'output_1' and the stdout stream will be 
#              returned from the the Worker
# peachvector: defines that the Project should be split into five Jobs. 
#              Peachvector elements are 2,4,6,8 and 10.
#
# The result files will be placed in a directory called 'output', which 
# is the default destination directory. Backslashes have been used to divide 
# the peach command to multiple lines.
