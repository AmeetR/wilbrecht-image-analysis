# two files, which will be transferred to each Worker that will participate in 
# the Project. The files in the Bundle will NOT be copied to the same temporary
# working directory as the executable program, because the 'copy' parameter 
# is not defined. Instead, the 'resource' parameter will be used to retrieve
# the location of the files on the Worker.

# Create a Project using peach. The parameters are explained below:
# command: defines that 'test.sh' will be executed on Linux Workers and
#          'test.bat' on Windows Workers.
# parameters: the first input argument will be replaced with the path 
#             where the files in the data bundle are located on the Worker. 
#             The second input argument will be replaced with a peachvector
#             element ('datafile1' for Job #1, 'datafile2' for for Job #2)
# platform:  defines that only Workers with a Linux or Windows can be assigned
#             Jobs
# imports: imports the bundle, which was created earlier with the 'createBundle'
#          command
# outputfiles: defines that the file 'output_1' will be returned from the Worker
# peachvector: defines that the Project should be split into two Jobs. 
#              elements are the strings 'datafile1' and 'datafile2'
# separator: defines that the peachvector elements are comma (,) separated
#
# The files 'datafile1' and 'datafile2' will stored in the Data Bundle which
# will be transferred to the server. The files will transferred to each Worker
# by importing the previously created Bundle. 
# The result files will be placed in a directory called 'output', which 
# is the default destination directory. Backslashes have been used to divide 
# the peach command to multiple lines.
