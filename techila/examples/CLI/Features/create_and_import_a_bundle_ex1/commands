# Create a Project using peach. The parameters are explained below:
# command: defines that 'test.sh' will be executed on Linux Workers and
#          'test.bat' on Windows Workers.
# parameters: defines that first input argument is an element of the 
#             peachvector element ('5' for Job #1, 'John' for for Job #2)
# platform:  defines that only Workers with a Linux or Windows can be assigned
#             Jobs
# imports: imports the bundle, which was created earlier with the 'createBundle'
#          command
# outputfiles: defines that the file 'output_1' will be returned from the Worker
# peachvector: defines that the Project should be split into two Jobs. 
#              elements are '5' and 'John'
# separator: defines that the peachvector elements are comma (,) separated
#
# The files 'datafile1' and 'datafile2' will stored in the Data Bundle which
# will be transferred to the server. The files will transferred to each Worker
# by importing the previously created Bundle. 
# The result files will be placed in a directory called 'output', which 
# is the default destination directory. Backslashes have been used to divide 
# the peach command to multiple lines.
