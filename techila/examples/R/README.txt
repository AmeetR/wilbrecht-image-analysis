Techila R examples
==================

The subfolders contains examples for R. If you are unsure on where to
begin, it is advisable that you start by familiarizing yourself with
the example material in the Tutorial or cloudfor folder. 

Preparation steps and example material walkthroughs can be found in 
the following guide:

The typical naming convention of the R-scripts in the "Tutorial" and
"Features" folders is explained below:

- R-scripts ending with "_dist" contain the function(s) (Worker Code),
  which will be distributed and executed on the Workers when the Local
  Control Code is executed.
- R-scripts beginning with "run_" contain the function (Local Control
  Code), which will be executed locally and will create the
  computational Project.

Some folders might contain R-scripts having a different naming
convention. The role of these functions is explained in:
