The typical naming convention of the C# source code files is explained below:

- Files beginning with "Run" contain the Local Control Code,
  which will be executed locally and will create the computational Project.
- Files beginning with "Local" contain a locally executable version of the
  example, which does not communicate with the Techila environment in any way.

Some folders might contain files having a different naming
convention. The role of these files is explained in:
